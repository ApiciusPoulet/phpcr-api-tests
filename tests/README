The structure of this folder reflects the structure of the "JCR 2.0 Specification"
document (see http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/2.0/index.html).

Each folder corresponds to a chapter of the specification and contains tests
named after the features.

The naming convention is NN_ChapterName/FeatureTest.php
where NN is the chapter number.

For example the test of the credentials belongs to chapter 4 (Connecting).
Thus it is named: 04_Connecting/CredentialsTest.php
