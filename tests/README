The structure of this folder reflects the structure of the "JCR 2.0 Specification"
document (see http://www.day.com/specs/jcr/2.0/index.html).

The naming convention for new test classes is the following: XXX_YY_FeatureTest
where:

    * XXX is the name of the chapter
    * YY is the chapter number
    * Feature is the name of the tested feature

For example the test of the Jackalope credentials belongs to chapter 4 (Connecting).
Thus it should be named: Connecting_4_CredentialsTest
