Usage:
Run phpunit inside of the root directory.

For usage with Zend you probably have to execute it manually like
this: 

/usr/local/zend/bin/php-cli /usr/local/zend/bin/phpunit tests/level1/ReadTest.php

Dependencies:
java in PATH
PHPUnit in PATH
PHPUnit in include_path

How to test your own code:
You need to change the phpunit.xml and write your own bootstrap file. The file
needs to provide the following:
function getRepository(config) which returns the repository
function getJCRSession(config) which returns the session
function getSimpleCredentials(user, password) which returns simpleCredentials
constants necessary to the JCR 1.0/JSR-170 specs

Installing PHPUnit:
Make sure you use the pear from Zend.
See http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html
$  /usr/local/zend/bin/pear install phpunit

Setting up Jackrabbit:
- Create tests workspace which is different from your default workspace.
See http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jackrabbit-configuration.html#JackrabbitConfiguration-Workspaceconfiguration
Or:
- Go to the directory you started jackrabbit-standalone (eg. /opt/svn/jackrabbit/jackrabbit-standalone/target)
- cd jackrabbit
- cd workspaces
- cp -r default tests
- cd tests
- change <Workspace name="default"> to <Workspace name="tests">
- start jackrabbit again




Setting up submodules:

After the first clone, don't forget to

git submodule init
git submodule update
