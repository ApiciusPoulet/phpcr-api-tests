## Usage

The jackalope-api-tests is a suite to test compliance for implementations of
the java content repository specification.
[https://github.com/jackalope/phpcr](https://github.com/jackalope/phpcr)

You need to provide a couple of files in order to let the tests detect your
implementation:

* Copy phpunit.xml.sample to phpunit.xml and adapt if necessary.
* Write your own bootstrap file. Have a look at inc/bootstrap.php.sample

Once you are done, run phpunit inside of the root directory. If you use a
standard php installation, this is usually along the lines of

    $ phpunit tests/read/ReadTest.php


## Setup

### Setting up submodules

After the first clone, don't forget to

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

### Dependencies

* PHPUnit in PATH
* PHPUnit in include_path

### Setting up Jackrabbit

Create tests workspace which is different from your default workspace.
See [http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jackrabbit-configuration.html#JackrabbitConfiguration-Workspaceconfiguration](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/jackrabbit-configuration.html#JackrabbitConfiguration-Workspaceconfiguration)

Or:

Go to the directory you started jackrabbit-standalone (eg. /opt/svn/jackrabbit/jackrabbit-standalone/target) and copy the default-workspace to a workspace called "test"

     cp -rp jackrabbit/workspaces/default jackrabbit/workspaces/tests

You then will have to adjust the jackrabbit/workspaces/tests/workspace.xml:

Change the following attribute:

     <Workspace name="default">
to 

    <Workspace name="tests">

Then start jackrabbit again


## Implementation

This code defines a set of unit tests against the PHPCR interfaces.
The tests are oriented at the javadoc of the JSR 283 interfaces.

tests/read contains tests for the base read functionality.
tests/write contains tests for the base write functionality.

## TODO

At the moment, the API tests assume that the storage backend is Jackrabbit.
This should be refactored out of the test suite and replaced by a method in
bootstrap.php to load fixtures into the backend.


This test classes are not completely covering the specification.
It would be nice if we were able to run the JSR-283 Technology Compliance
Kit (TCK) against php implementations.

Once we manage to do that, we could hopefully also use the performance test suite
